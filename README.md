# Assurance_company_test
In this repo you can find the solution provided to a technical test I was asked to work on during a recruitment process I was involved in.

The objective of the test was to create a model able to predict the target variable in the test set.
No contextual information has been provided, the only available information about the problem was the train and the test set.
The resulting analysis and the predicting model should have been developed in 2 hours.

In "Assurance_test.ipynb" you have the notebook I worked on with some comments to justify the development choices and the logic behind the construction of the final model.
